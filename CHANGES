$MODULE = "MLDBM::Sync"; $VERSION = .01; $DATE = '2/7/2001';

+ Initial release with flock concurrent access control to 
  MLDBM databases.  

+ Also MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File wrapper for getting around the 
  1024 byte / record limitation for sDBM_File.  Writes data
  in segments of 128 bytes.  This was created because SDBM_File
  access is an order of magnitude faster than DB_File on Linux
  with tie/untie per write in the MLDBM::Sync model, which is 
  for i/o flushing do dbms don't get corrupt.  

  But, then one has to worry about exceeding the 1024 byte limit, 
  which can happen for serializing larger objects.  Well worry
  no more!
