NAME
      MLDBM::Sync (BETA) - safe concurrent access to MLDBM databases

SYNOPSIS
      use MLDBM::Sync;                       # this gets the default, SDBM_File
      use MLDBM qw(DB_File Storable);        # use Storable for serializing
      use MLDBM qw(MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File);  # use extended SDBM_File, handles values > 1024 bytes

      # NORMAL PROTECTED read/write with implicit locks per i/o request
      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync' [..other DBM args..] or die $!;
      $cache{"AAAA"} = "BBBB";
      my $value = $cache{"AAAA"};

      # SERIALIZED PROTECTED read/write with explicit lock for both i/o requests
      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $sync_dbm_obj->Lock;
      $cache{"AAAA"} = "BBBB";
      my $value = $cache{"AAAA"};
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # SERIALIZED PROTECTED read access with explicit read lock for both reads
      $sync_dbm_obj->ReadLock;
      my @keys = keys %cache;
      my $value = $cache{'AAAA'};
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # KEY CHECKSUMS, for lookups on MD5 checksums on large keys
      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $sync_dbm_obj->SyncKeysChecksum(1);
      my $large_key = "KEY" x 10000;
      $sync{$large_key} = "LARGE";
      my $value = $sync{$large_key};

DESCRIPTION
    This module wraps around the MLDBM interface, by handling concurrent
    access to MLDBM databases with file locking, and flushes i/o explicity
    per lock/unlock. The new [Read]Lock()/UnLock() API can be used to
    serialize requests logically and improve performance for bundled reads &
    writes.

      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;

      # Write locked critical section
      $sync_dbm_obj->Lock;
        ... all accesses to DBM LOCK_EX protected, and go to same tied file handles
        $cache{'KEY'} = 'VALUE';
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # Read locked critical section
      $sync_dbm_obj->ReadLock;
        ... all read accesses to DBM LOCK_SH protected, and go to same tied files
        ... WARNING, cannot write to DBM in ReadLock() section, will die()
        my $value = $cache{'KEY'};
      $sync_dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # Normal access OK too, without explicity locking
      $cache{'KEY'} = 'VALUE';
      my $value = $cache{'KEY'};

    MLDBM continues to serve as the underlying OO layer that serializes
    complex data structures to be stored in the databases. See the MLDBM the
    BUGS manpage section for important limitations.

INSTALL
    Like any other CPAN module, either use CPAN.pm, or perl -MCPAN `-e'
    shell, or get the file MLDBM-Sync-x.xx.tar.gz, unzip, untar and:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

LOCKING
    The MLDBM::Sync wrapper protects MLDBM databases by locking and
    unlocking around read and write requests to the databases. Also
    necessary is for each new lock to tie() to the database internally,
    untie()'ing when unlocking. This flushes any i/o for the dbm to the
    operating system, and allows for concurrent read/write access to the
    databases.

    Without any extra effort from the developer, an existing MLDBM database
    will benefit from MLDBM::sync.

      my $dbm_obj = tie %dbm, ...;
      $dbm{"key"} = "value";

    As a write or STORE operation, the above will automatically cause the
    following:

      $dbm_obj->Lock; # also ties
      $dbm{"key"} = "value";
      $dbm_obj->UnLock; # also unties

    Just so, a read or FETCH operation like:

      my $value = $dbm{"key"};

    will really trigger:

      $dbm_obj->ReadLock; # also ties
      my $value = $dbm{"key"};
      $dbm_obj->Lock; # also unties

    However, these lock operations are expensive because of the underlying
    tie()/untie() that occurs for i/o flushing, so when bundling reads &
    writes, a developer may explicitly use this API for greater performance:

      # tie once to database, write 100 times
      $dbm_obj->Lock;
      for (1..100) {
        $dbm{$_} = $_ * 100;
        ...
      }
      $dbm_obj->UnLock;

      # only tie once to database, and read 100 times
      $dbm_obj->ReadLock;
      for(1..100) {
        my $value = $dbm{$_};  
        ...
      }
      $dbm_obj->UnLock;

KEYS CHECKSUM
    A common operation on database lookups is checksumming the key, prior to
    the lookup, because the key could be very large, and all one really
    wants is the data it maps too. To enable this functionality
    automatically with MLDBM::Sync, just:

      my $sync_dbm_obj = tie %cache, 'MLDBM::Sync', '/tmp/syncdbm', O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640;
      $sync_dbm_obj->SyncKeysChecksum(1);

     !! WARNING: keys() & each() do not work on these databases
     !! as of v.03, so the developer will not be fooled into thinking
     !! the stored key values are meaningful to the calling application 
     !! and will die() if called.
     !!
     !! This behavior could be relaxed in the future.
 
    An example of this might be to cache a XSLT conversion, which are
    typically very expensive. You have the XML data and the XSLT data, so
    all you do is:

      # $xml_data, $xsl_data are strings
      my $xslt_output;
      unless ($xslt_output = $cache{$xml_data.'&&&&'.$xsl_data}) {
        ... do XSLT conversion here for $xslt_output ...
        $cache{$xml_data.'&&&&'.xsl_data} = $xslt_output;
      }

    What you save by doing this is having to create HUGE keys to lookup on,
    which no DBM is likely to do efficiently. This is the same method that
    File::Cache uses internally to hash its file lookups in its directories.

New MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File
    SDBM_File, the default used for MLDBM and therefore MLDBM::Sync has a
    limit of 1024 bytes for the size of a record.

    SDBM_File is also an order of magnitude faster for small records to use
    with MLDBM::Sync, than DB_File or GDBM_File, because the tie()/untie()
    to the dbm is much faster. Therefore, bundled with MLDBM::Sync release
    is a MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File layer which works around this 1024 byte
    limit. To use, just:

      use MLDBM qw(MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File);

    It works by breaking up up the STORE() values into small 128 byte
    segments, and spreading those segments across many records, creating a
    virtual record layer. It also uses Compress::Zlib to compress STORED
    data, reducing the number of these 128 byte records. In benchmarks, 128
    byte record segments seemed to be a sweet spot for space/time
    effienciency, as SDBM_File created very bloated *.pag files for 128+
    byte records.

BENCHMARKS
    In the distribution ./bench directory is a bench_sync.pl script that can
    benchmark using the various DBMs with MLDBM::Sync.

    The MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File DBM is special because is uses SDBM_File for
    fast small inserts, but slows down linearly with the size of the data
    being inserted and read, with the speed matching that of GDBM_File &
    DB_File somewhere around 20,000 bytes.

    So for DBM key/value pairs up to 10000 bytes, you are likely better off
    with MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File if you can afford the extra space it uses.
    At 20,000 bytes, time is a wash, and disk space is greater, so you might
    as well use DB_File or GDBM_File.

    Note that MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File is ALPHA as of 2/27/2001.

WARNINGS
    MLDBM::Sync is in BETA. As of 2/27/2001 I have been using it in
    development for months, and been using its techniques for years in
    Apache::ASP $Session & $Application data storage. Future releases of
    Apache::ASP will use MLDBM::Sync for its Apache::ASP::State base
    implementation instead of MLDBM

    MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File is ALPHA quality. Databases created while using
    it may not be compatible with future releases if the segment manager
    code or support for compression changes.

TODO
    Production testing.
